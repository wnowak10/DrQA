      "content": "Before Justin.tv grew into Twitch and Socialcam we spent years with a broken understanding of how to build product. We had meandering product meetings where we didn\u2019t write down our decisions. We didn\u2019t carefully spec new products so team members often had slightly different ideas about what we were building. We always wanted to build fully formed products instead of MVPs. And we rarely spec\u2019d the analytics for new products so we often didn\u2019t know how they were performing\u00a0post-launch.Development cycles often ran months. We were sick of the new feature by the time we launched them so we didn\u2019t iterate. Our product roadmap was so long that team members weren\u2019t excited to brainstorm new products because it was unclear if they would ever be built. And most horribly, product decisions were made exclusively by the founders in a non-transparent process. Things were a\u00a0mess.In this post I\u2019m going to cover product development cycle fundamentals that I learned to help solve all of the problems above. This will help you rapidly iterate, measure, test, and improve your product while fully engaging your team. This is not that same as shipping an MVP. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve released an MVP and are figuring out what to do next, which is where most startups spend most of their\u00a0time.Define Your Development Cycle LengthYour development cycle should be dictated by your product. At Socialcam we were building for iOS so we settled on a two week cycle, which allowed us to thoroughly test before releasing to the App Store. If you\u2019re doing a web app your cycle can be shorter, if it\u2019s hardware it might be longer. The key is to structure the cycle so that teammates stay excited and still feel like they can brainstorm new\u00a0ideas.Determine Your Goal(s) and Identify the Product LeadWe ran one and only one team meeting. It was the product meeting and it happened on the first day of the dev cycle. Sometimes this meeting would go for five hours\u00a0(sorry).Every product meeting was focused around one of three goals:1. Increasing content creation2. Increasing new users3. Increasing\u00a0retentionWhichever goal we chose would be the focus of the meeting and, therefore, the next two\u00a0weeks.As the product person on the team my role was to protect and improve the dev cycle and moderate the product meetings to ensure all team members felt comfortable contributing. Oftentimes just getting the opportunity to voice your idea and having it written on the board - even if it isn\u2019t built - massively increases buy-in of the\u00a0process.Organized and Inclusive BrainstormWhile we were brainstorming, ideas would be written on the whiteboard in one of the following categorizes: new features/feature iterations, maintenance, and A/B tests. Everyone was expected to contribute. Debates or putting down other people\u2019s ideas wasn\u2019t permitted. This was the time when everyone felt free to contribute without fear of judgement. The product lead is responsible for creating and maintaining that\u00a0environment.From there each brainstormed item would be graded by the engineer in the meeting as easy (several can be done in a day), medium (half a day for one person), and hard (most of the dev cycle). No item could be so hard that it would last into another cycle and if it was, we\u2019d break it into smaller chunks. Usually this grading would be done item by item by the engineer with the most experience in that specific area. iOS features were ranked by the iOS guy and so on and so forth. This really helped non-technical people understand which of their ideas were easy to build and which were hard. With this realization they often got better at thinking up easier and easier MVPs of their ideas. These easy ideas would then get built and, if they worked, would be iterated\u00a0upon.Building a ConsensusOnce we\u2019d written our ideas out we began to pick what we would work in through consensus. We would start with the hard ideas\u2013it was easy to form consensus because we knew we could only do one and because we knew that we would start a new dev cycle in two weeks. Then medium and then easy. Developing that consensus wasn\u2019t very hard because everyone had the opportunity to suggest their own ideas and because there was a clear goal and objective measurement of how long each idea would take to build. This process allowed you to grade the quality of your own idea and didn\u2019t allow personalities to bully their pet ideas\u00a0through.Clear Spec and Clear Measurements of SuccessAfterwards we would spec out each of the items on our list in detail and assign each item to a team member (or multiple team members). We would also spec the stats we needed to track in order to measure how effective the feature was. We would never release a feature without releasing the analytics for that feature and understanding what specific measurable result we wanted to create. Finally, we separated out the need to haves from the nice to haves on the list. If there wasn\u2019t time, the nice to haves would not be built. After that was done we would take a picture of the whiteboard and delete it. We didn\u2019t have a product roadmap outside of these two weeks and every product meeting we would start from scratch with the new goal, new analytics data from our last two weeks, and also often new insights from in-person user testing, which we tried to do once a\u00a0month.Working During the Development CycleFor me, work after the first monday of the development cycle was a silent affair. My job was to get all the business and operations tasks done. Then I\u2019d dig through Mixpanel looking for interesting product insights or potential bugs. Finally, I also ran monthly user testing sessions in our office. My teammates - engineers and a designer - would work quietly and quickly knowing they had projects with limited scopes that were well spec\u2019d out. Finally, during the last three days of every development cycle we would all stop building and test. We had a testing list in Excel that included manual tests for all of our basic functionality. Every cycle we added tests for new features built in that cycle and we tested all items on our testing list twice. Everyone on the team tested and we often had competitions for who could test the fastest and who found the most bugs. Testing sucks so it\u2019s important that the burden is\u00a0shared.The ResultsAt the end of the day, Socialcam did not achieve our dream of being the \u201cInstagram for Video\u201d. In fact what we should have built looks a lot closer to Snapchat. But this process did allow us to iterate extremely quickly. As a result we were able to produce a laundry list of cool features very quickly: video filters, video borders, video titles, video soundtracks, video feed optimizations, multiple visual redesigns, user profiles, recommended channels, front back camera switching during a video, and much much more. It also allowed us to experiment with growth features that produced 16 million downloads in about 3 months and over 100 million people watching video on our website during the same period of time. Most importantly though, we did all of this work quickly, efficiently, without major arguments, issues with founder commitment, or really any team problems at all. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if instead of selling the company we kept building for another year\u2026 But that\u2019s another\u00a0story.Thank you Jared, Geoff, and Craig for helping me with this post, Ammon and Guillaume my co-founders at Socialcam, and Justin, Emmett, and Kyle for surviving all the pain from the good old days at\u00a0Justin.tv.",

      "content": "When people discuss startups they tend to talk about inspiration and creativity. This leads founders to believe they can imagineer a solution to any problem they\u2019re trying to solve. In reality, executing a startup is a balance between creativity/intuition/instinct and the scientific method: hypothesize > a/b test > conclude > repeat.Inspiration will help you find a problem to solve. Creativity will allow you to brainstorm potential solutions to that problem. The scientific method will guide you toward which of these solutions will actually solve your customer\u2019s problem.Running a scientific method requires having measurement in place. It requires that you have pre-existing analytics measuring what your users are doing every day. And it requires that when you build new features, you immediately add them to your analytics system\u2013minute one. In order for this to work you cannot have the attitude: \u201cThis is obvious, why would we measure it?\u201dMany companies make the mistake of only using internal analytics. They think that if they need an answer they can just write a DB query to get it. Unfortunately, the harder it is for you to ask a question, the fewer questions you will ask. By using a standard analytics product (we\u2019ve funded a bunch of them at YC) you enable everyone in your company (even non-programmers) to ask an unlimited number of questions and get the answers quickly. This is hugely important. I actually think it would be a good idea for companies to measure employee usage of their analytics product. Measurement and talking to users improve your ability to be inspired, creative, and break the rules.Here\u2019s an example: Tim Robinson, one of our employees at Justin.tv, was building a payments funnel for a new product we were releasing. When trying to figure out what to put on the header and footer of the payment flow the obvious idea was to use the standard header and footer from our website. But instead of thinking, \u201cthis is obvious, why would we measure it\u201d, he measured everything users did when going through the flow. By measuring he realized instead of moving through the flow with the \u201cobvious\u201d next buttons, users were clicking on the logo at the top of the page, the links on the footers, everywhere! So he started removing these items. A designer might say he was screwing up the aesthetics of the site but as an engineer he could see through the analytics that every time he removed links, payment conversion would increase. By applying the scientific method of hypothesize > a/b test > conclude > repeat he was able to build a product that produced a third of our revenue at JTV. What made his work even more amazing is that Justin.tv at that time wasn\u2019t really data driven at all. Perhaps it was his background as a scientist led him to this method or perhaps it was common sense, but without this feature Justin.tv would have died. Thanks Tim!The best companies (and employees) are willing to use data to back up their decision making. They don\u2019t believe that standards or aesthetics are rules written in stone. They don\u2019t believe that only product people or founders know the solutions to problems. They believe that their users can help them understand what to build and how to build it if they are willing to implement the analytics, listen, and test.",

      "content": "A lot of the advice we give startups is tactical; meant to be helpful on a day to day or week to week basis. But some advice is more fundamental. We\u2019ve collected here what we at YC consider the most important, most transformative advice for startups. Whether common sense or counter-intuitive, the guidance below will help most startups find their path to success.The first thing we always tell founders is to launch their product right away; for the simple reason that this is the only way to fully understand customers\u2019 problems and whether the product meets their needs. Surprisingly, launching a mediocre product as soon as possible, and then talking to customers and iterating, is much better than waiting to build the \u201cperfect\u201d product. This is true as long as the product contains a \u201cquantum of utility\u201d for customers whose value overwhelms problems any warts might present.Once launched, we suggest founders do things that don\u2019t scale (Do Things That Don\u2019t Scale by Paul Graham1). Many startup advisors persuade startups to scale way too early. This will require the building of technology and processes to support that scaling, which, if premature, will be a waste of time and effort. This strategy often leads to failure and even startup death. Rather, we tell startups to get their first customer by any means necessary, even by manual work that couldn\u2019t be managed for more than ten, much less 100 or 1000 customers. At this stage, founders are still trying to figure out what needs to be built and the best way to do that is talk directly to customers. For example, the Airbnb founders originally offered to \u201cprofessionally\u201d photograph the homes and apartments of their earliest customers in order to make their listings more attractive to renters. Then, they went and took the photographs themselves. The listings on their site improved, conversions improved, and they had amazing conversations with their customers. This was entirely unscalable, yet proved essential in learning how to build a vibrant marketplace.Talking to users usually yields a long, complicated list of features to build. One piece of advice that YC partner Paul Buchheit (PB) always gives in this case is to look for the \u201c90/10 solution\u201d. That is, look for a way in which you can accomplish 90% of what you want with only 10% of the work/effort/time. If you search hard for it, there is almost always a 90/10 solution available. Most importantly, a 90% solution to a real customer problem which is available right away, is much better than a 100% solution that takes ages to build.As companies begin to grow there are often tons of potential distractions. Conferences, dinners, meeting with venture capitalists or large company corporate development types (Don\u2019t Talk to Corp Dev by Paul Graham2), chasing after press coverage and so on. (YC co-founder Jessica Livingston created a pretty comprehensive list of the wrong things on which to focus [How Not To Fail by Jessica Livingston 3.]) We always remind founders not to lose sight that the most important tasks for an early stage company are to write code and talk to users. For any company, software or otherwise, this means that in order to make something people want: you must launch something, talk to your users to see if it serves their needs, and then take their feedback and iterate. These tasks should occupy almost all of your time/focus. For great companies this cycle never ends. Similarly, as your company evolves there will be many times where founders are forced to choose between multiple directions for their company. Sam Altman always points out that it is nearly always better to take the more ambitious path. It is actually extraordinary how often founders manage to avoid tackling these sorts of problems and focus on other things. Sam calls this \u201cfake work\u201d, because it tends to be more fun than real work (The Post YC Slumpby Sam Altman4).When it comes to customers most founders don\u2019t realize that they get to choose customers as much as customers get to choose them. We often say that a small group of customers who love you is better than a large group who kind of like you. In other words, recruiting 10 customers who have a burning problem is much better than 1000 customers who have a passing annoyance. It is easy to make mistakes when choosing your customers so sometimes it\u2019s also critical for startups to fire their customers5. Some customers can cost way more than they provide in either revenue or learning. For example, Justin.tv/Twitch only became a breakout success when they focused their efforts toward video game broadcasters and away from people trying to stream copy written content (Users You Don\u2019t Wantby Michael Seibel5.)Growth is always a focus for startups, since a startup without growth is usually a failure. However, how and when to grow is often misunderstood. YC is sometimes criticised for pushing companies to grow at all costs, but in fact we push companies to talk to their users, build what they want, and iterate quickly. Growth is a natural result of doing these three things successfully. Yet, growth is not always the right choice. If you have not yet made something your customers want \u2013 in other words, have found product market fit, it makes little sense to grow (The Real Product Market Fit by Michael Seibel6). Poor retention is always the result. Also, if you have an unprofitable product, growth merely drains cash from the company. As PB likes to say, it never makes sense to take 80 cents from a customer and then hand them a dollar back. The fact that unit economics really matter shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, but too many startups seem to forget this basic fact (Unit Economics by Sam Altman7).Startup founders\u2019 intuition will always be to do more whereas usually the best strategy is almost always to do less, really well. For example, founders are frequently tempted to chase big deals with large companies which represent amazing, company validating relationships. However, deals between large companies and tiny startups seldom end well for the startup. They take too long, cost too much, and often fail completely. One of the hardest things about doing a startup is choosing what to do, since you will always have an infinite list of things that could be done (Startup Prioritiesby Geoff Ralston8). It is vital that very early a startup choose the one or two key metrics it will use to measure success, then founders should choose what to do based nearly exclusively on how the task will impact those metrics. When your early stage product isn\u2019t working it\u2019s often tempting to immediately build new features in order to solve every problem the customer seems to have instead of talking to the customer and focusing only on the most acute problem they have.Founders often find it surprising to hear that they shouldn\u2019t worry if their company seems badly broken. It turns out that nearly every startup has deep, fundamental issues, even those that will end up being billion dollar companies. Success is not determined by whether you are broken at the beginning, but rather what the founders do about the inevitable problems. Your job as a founder will often seem to be continuously righting a capsized ship. This is normal.It is very difficult as a new startup founder not to obsess about competition, actual and potential. It turns out that spending any time worrying about your competitors is nearly always a very bad idea. We like to say that startup companies always die of suicide not murder. There will come a time when competitive dynamics are intensely important to the success or failure of your company, but it is highly unlikely to be true in the first year or two.A few words on fundraising (A Guide to Seed Fundraising by Geoff Ralston9). The first, best bit of advice is to raise money as quickly as possible and then get back to work. It is often easy to actually see when a company is fundraising by looking at their growth curve and when it flattens out they are raising money. Equally important is to understand that valuation is not equal to success or even probability of success (Fundraising Rounds are not Milestones by Michael Seibel10). Some of Y Combinator\u2019s very best companies raised on tiny initial valuations (Airbnb, Dropbox, Twitch, are all good examples). By the way, it is vital to remember that the money you raise IS NOT your money. You have a fiduciary and ethical/moral duty to spend the money only to improve the prospects of your company.It is also important to stay sane during the inevitable craziness of startup life. So we always tell founders to make sure they take breaks, spend time with friends and family, get enough sleep and exercise in between bouts of extraordinarily intense, focused work. Lastly, a brief word on failure. It turns out most companies fail fast because founders fall out. The relationships with your cofounders matter more than you think and open, honest communications between founders makes future debacles much less likely. In fact, it turns out that one of the best things you can do to make your startup successful, in fact, to be successful in life, is to simply be nice (Mean People Fail by Paul Graham11.)The Pocket Guide of Essential YC Advice\u2022 Launch now\u2022 Build something people want\u2022 Do things that don\u2019t scale\u2022 Find the 90 / 10 solution\u2022 Find 10-100 customers who love your product\u2022 All startups are badly broken at some point\u2022 Write code \u2013 talk to users\u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s not your money\u201d\u2022 Growth is the result of a great product not the precursor\u2022 Don\u2019t scale your team/product until you have built something people want\u2022 Valuation is not equal to success or even probability of success\u2022 Avoid long negotiated deals with big customers if you can\u2022 Avoid big company corporate development queries \u2013 they will only waste time\u2022 Avoid conferences unless they are the best way to get customers\u2022 Pre-product market fit \u2013 do things that don\u2019t scale: remain small/nimble\u2022 Startups can only solve one problem well at any given time\u2022 Founder relationships matter more than you think\u2022 Sometimes you need to fire your customers (they might be killing you)\u2022 Ignore your competitors, you will more likely die of suicide than murder\u2022 Most companies don\u2019t die because they run out of money\u2022 Be nice!

      "content": "The best press advice I ever got was from Mike Arrington and M.G. Siegler while they were speaking at an SV Angel CEO conference. They said:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Treat PR like biz dev.Once I heard that, everything clicked. Before then I\u2019d wasted mental energy thinking there were special rules for talking to the press and getting great stories for my company. I needed cool and catchy subject lines for my emails. I should have a list of a hundred reporters that I blast with new story ideas. I should write press releases. Needless to say most of these efforts ended in failure. Sound familiar?Treating PR like business development means developing relationships with reporters as people, getting introduced through warm connections instead of cold emails, and creating a fair value exchange. Here\u2019s the process I advise YC companies to follow when they\u2019re ready for press.Step One: Generate NewsMany founders pitch reporters profiles and stories about their company that could be written today, next week, or next month. Everyone wants a \u201cprofile piece\u201d on their startup but most of the time those stories aren\u2019t valuable to reporters. What makes a valuable story is news.What is News?News is timely. It makes more sense to talk about it today rather than tomorrow. News attracts attention now and that\u2019s what reporters want. News for most startups can be broken up into these 4 categories:1. Product Launches and FeaturesThese are things coming out today. Not yesterday, not tomorrow, today. Think Instagram Stories or Facebook Timeline. Typically you are looking for user facing features. In my last company, Socialcam, we would reach out to the press when we released video filters, the ability to add soundtracks to videos, or user profiles.2. Product/Sales MilestonesThis could be hitting a million users, $100k MRR, or maybe a million guests per night. It\u2019s important for this number to be as big as possible (relative to your size of startup) and I\u2019d recommend you sandbag this number \u2013 i.e. wait until you\u2019re 25% past the milestone to announce \u2013 so that you\u2019re that much closer to announcing the next milestone.3. Significant BD Deals or CustomersDid you just get a team at Airbnb or Instacart to start using your product or service? Did you partner with GM to build a network of self-driving cars? If you have their permission you should consider announcing it.4. FundraisingFor better or worse, fundraising is conflated with traction/success so it is a topic people want to read about. If you have raised an angel round or series A/B/etc. most reporters will consider this news and potential employees will notice it, too.Note: Many of the examples I\u2019ve used might seem a little aggressive for an early stage startup. My goal is not to discourage you but to provide examples that will be generally understood. If you have any new product, milestone, deal, or investment round you should strongly consider pitching it.Step Two: Make Your Own Press ContactsReporters want to talk to CEOs and co-founders\u2013not PR people. As an early stage startup founder you should be building reporter relationships and making pitches. Your success rate will go up and you will actually spend less time and money on PR. Take it from me\u2013we spent over $100,000 on PR agencies and PR people as an early stage startup before we figured this out.How Do I Make Press Contacts?Don\u2019t spray and pray. It\u2019s stupid.The best method to meet a tech reporter is by having the CEO or a co-founder get a warm intro. If you\u2019re a YC founder, the YC founder network is super helpful for these. The reporter you want to meet has definitely written about someone you know. Have them intro you. Proper etiquette is to ask your friend for an intro to only one reporter. If you aren\u2019t a YC founder, make friends with other startups and reach out to your startup community for warm intros.Here\u2019s what should be in your intro. The reporter should be able to read it and reply in thirty seconds.\u2013 News. Describe your news in one sentence.\u2013 For an exclusive: Let the reporter know you\u2019re offering an exclusive.\u2013 For an embargo: Say when you\u2019re making the announcement. Include the date and time.\u2013 A request for a twenty minute call. Be courteous. You don\u2019t need to meet in person.\u00a0When you get the reporter on the phone, be ready with three to five reasons why your news and your company is important. Make them clear and then, at the end of your call, offer your notes and any relevant collateral (screenshots, graphs, logos, pictures, etc). This will provide you with an opportunity to be courteous and provide reporters with the language you prefer.Step Three: Pitch Those Contacts an ExclusiveAlmost all startups should be offering their story as an exclusive to one tech reporter at a time. Your target audience \u2013 investors, potential employees, motivated customers, early adopters \u2013 exist in high concentration in just a few tech outlets. Getting blanket coverage across a bunch of tech blogs is often not worth the struggle and can piss people off when embargoes are broken.Step Four: Share News at a Consistent CadenceThere is a philosophy in the PR world that the number of press mentions per story is an important metric. This causes them to put all the best news in one story, infrequently, and try to get the most reporters to write about it at once. For startups I actually think this isn\u2019t the best strategy.For me, the benefits of PR are hard to measure but they do exist. It\u2019s like funding basic research in science, you can\u2019t predict the advances but they do happen when you invest consistently over time.To see real startup PR results you\u2019re better off getting one story every month or every other month versus one huge story every year. To do that, don\u2019t combine all of your news into one story, spread it out across multiple stories. Also when you are looking at your stats or sitting in product meetings with your team, keep an eye out for potential news that you can pitch. I tell YC startups to maintain a queue of 3-5 pieces of news that you will want to announce in the coming 6 months. It takes the pressure off you if one of those pieces of news doesn\u2019t get picked up, and it helps you keep a regular cadence of positive news about your company in the press.Other Things to Keep in MindJust like BD, don\u2019t expect to get every meeting and story. When a reporter says \u201cno\u201d, ask yourself why. Were you really giving them news and doing all the other things right? If you\u2019re doing all those things well, you should have a 25-50% success rate.After six to twelve months of keeping up a good cadence and sharing real news, you should be relatively friendly with two to five reporters. In other words, they\u2019ve written about your company enough that you\u2019ve probably met them in person and certainly they\u2019ll reply to most of your emails.Later on in your startup\u2019s life there will hopefully become a point when press organically pays attention to your company and wants to proactively write about what you are doing\u2013\u2013Dropbox and Airbnb are great examples. At this point, oftentimes it is strategic to start creating distance between the CEO/Founders and the press. This is when PR people can be very helpful. They create a buffer that allows you to be more strategic about what you announce, when, and to whom.Lastly, remember that doing PR is a very small part of being a good CEO/Founder. Make sure you aren\u2019t dedicating more than 5% of your time to press and don\u2019t expect PR to create observable miracles (tons of users, customers, investment offers, etc). Most of the benefit I\u2019ve received from PR only became obvious weeks or months after a story was posted.Thanks to Kat Manalac and Craig Cannon for contributing to this article.",

It\u2019s stupid.The best method to meet a tech reporter is by having the CEO or a co-founder get a warm intro. "

      "content": "When people ask me for tech career advice I find it helpful to lay out the three paths I\u2019ve encountered most in my career: founder, executive, and employee. I\u2019m leaving out investor because the best path to being an investor that I\u2019ve seen starts with being successful (or failing) at one of these three first.\u00a0Below I\u2019ll outline what I see as the pros/cons and useful strategies for each role.\u00a0I wrote this post though because when I talk to people about their careers I\u2019m surprised at how often they focus on only one of these paths without taking the time to consider other options. Often when they get advice, people tell them to follow the path that they followed (as a YC partner and former founder, I\u2019m very guilty of this).\u00a0I don\u2019t attach value judgements to these three paths. In my ten years in The Bay Area I\u2019ve seen friends lead successful and fulfilled lives following all three.FounderPro\u2022 Work on something you\u2019re passionate about\u2022 Bring something new into the world\u2022 High level of responsibility often inspires extreme productivity\u2022 Choose the people you work with\u2022 Learn new skills at an extremely fast paceCon\u2022 Incredibly stressful. Even success hurts\u2022 Probably won\u2019t maximize your personal earnings\u2022 significant financial/skillset/location hurdles to get started\u2022 Large scale success often requires decade plus commitment\u2022 Commitment level can significantly hurt personal relationshipsStrategy for People Who Want to be FoundersYour initial goal is to accumulate the prerequisites to being a founder.1. Identify potential teammates you can work with who have the required technical skills to help you build your MVP.2. Figure out the financial plan. I.e. Do you have enough money in savings, do you have friends/family who can provide seed investment, can you bootstrap, can you reduce your spending and save enough give yourself 6-12 months to work on your idea?3. Identify a problem that you and your potential teammates are passionate about solving.4. The least important (but still required) is having an idea on how of how to solve the problem.Many people who want to be founders have one or more of these prerequisites missing. A popular mistake is trying to hustle around a missing prerequisite instead of solving the underlying issue. If your team doesn\u2019t have the technical skills to build your MVP, don\u2019t work with a dev shop. Make friends with people who do have these skills. Convince them to join you.Often times there are hard barriers preventing people from starting a company. In these cases my best advice is to move to a tech hub (preferably the Bay Area) and work for a tech company until you can save the money, make friends with the right potential teammates, or discover the problem that you are passionate about. It usually takes at least 10 years to build a large and impactful company. It\u2019s fine to delay your start date in order to give yourself the best chance of success.Notice that one of the prerequisites isn\u2019t experience. Experience is over-valued (not completely unimportant \u2013 but massively over-valued) by people who are thinking about starting a company. In almost all cases, no matter what knowledge you bring to the table, you will learn most of what you need to know about your problem, your customer, and the best solution after you start your company.Executive (Senior Manager at a Large Company)Pro\u2022 Stable income/benefits/etc.\u2022 High level of prestige (only very successful founders have more prestige)\u2022 A higher likelihood of having a huge impact (given that most startups fail).\u2022 Doesn\u2019t require building a team and acquiring money to get startedCon\u2022 Producing results isn\u2019t necessarily how you move up the corporate ladder. Internal politics are usually as important, if not more so.\u2022 Success can be hampered or even prevented by others inside of your organization\u2022 Requires the ability to pick companies that will be growing and successful for a long time\u2022 Takes a long time to get a significant amount of responsibilityStrategies for People Who Want to be ExecutivesI actually see two strategies within this path.The first strategy is to pick a company that is growing quickly. If you do manage to pick a company like this early, then you\u2019ll get more responsibility as the company grows \u2013 I also assume you are a friendly and productive team player. For example, if you were one of the first 100 people at Facebook and you stayed there for ten years, you would have many opportunities to become an executive. The hard part here is that picking a company that will grow rapidly for many years is extremely difficult (in many ways your task is similar to a VC).The other path is to go to work for a more established company. The people I\u2019ve seen do this effectively don\u2019t think about working their way up within one company alone. They often think about moving diagonally up between a set of established name brand companies until they eventually land in an executive role. For example, you start out of college at Google, get hired at Dropbox as a team lead, move to Yahoo to become a director, move back to Google \u2013 so on and so forth.People on the executive path either have to think like VCs and pick a company that is going to be one of the winners over the next 10 years, or have their head on a swivel to constantly look for better and better opportunities both inside and outside of their current company.Employee (individual contributor / middle manager)Pro\u2022 Stable income/benefits/etc.\u2022 More work and fewer meetings\u2022 More often directly affecting the customer through your work\u2022 With a high demand skill-set you have flexibility in where/how much you work\u2022 Often have more time to spend with friends and familyCon\u2022 Productivity can be blocked by bad management\u2022 You often don\u2019t have control what you work on\u2022 Often don\u2019t get a voice in major decisions \u2013 even when you \u201cknow the right answer\u201d\u2022 It\u2019s harder to become very wealthy\u2022 It can be boring\u2022 If you don\u2019t maintain a high demand skillset or your productivity drops it\u2019s easier to be firedStrategies for People Who Want to be EmployeesYour strategy for picking a place to work is similar to an exec\u2019s. You either need to spot and join a quickly growing company or find a way into a well known successful company. It\u2019s much easier to go between brand name companies when you start with a brand name company. Also, in my experience, it\u2019s much easier to optimize this path as a software developer.The last thing I\u2019ll say is it takes time to be good at each role. When you\u2019re in college there is this idea that you should take your 20s to discover yourself and the find the work that is most enjoyable to you. The problem is that if it takes 5-10 years to truly get good at something and you spend 10 years discovering what you want to get good at\u2026it\u2019s going to take a long time for you to feel like a highly skilled productive person (and to recieve the rewards that come with this). It\u2019s not that you shouldn\u2019t explore, it\u2019s that you need to understand the costs of that exploration and plan accordingly.Thanks to Daniel Gross, Aaron Harris, and Craig Cannon for reading drafts of this post.",

      "content": "When you\u2019re just getting started, many startups will take every user they can get. They have a strong idea of a problem and they want to attract as many users with that problem as possible. Unfortunately, when you open up the barn doors you get all sorts of people with all sorts of problems. Some of them will try to hijack your product to solve a problem you didn\u2019t intend to solve. By and large, these hijackers are users you don\u2019t\u00a0want.For example, say I\u2019m starting Uber for babysitters. Our target customers are parents with kids from around the age 4 to 12. These kids we can service with committed babysitters who don\u2019t have special training therefore allowing us to provide our service at a reasonable price point to a wide variety of users. Now, what happens if someone with an infant or developmentally challenged teenager signs up? Their needs present an entirely new set of problems, problems that could be solved by a startup but not necessarily by ours. Remember you don\u2019t have to pivot your business because a customer needs something that you don\u2019t\u00a0offer.Why Not Solve Their Problem, Too?Sometimes you should. Sometimes the hijacker users are actually showing you where there\u2019s an even more acute need, an even bigger problem. But, in other cases, they are leading you into a trap where you are solving a problem for a smaller group of users or in the worst case just them. This is a consulting business and if you are doing a tech startup - you don\u2019t want to be in the business of solving one off problems for\u00a0users.So what should to you? Well, there is no right answer but before diving into this new problem have this conversation with your co-founders. Should you explore switching the problem you are trying to solve? Does this user represent a larger group? Are the economics of your business different or broken if you serve this user or others like them? Does this user represent an even better opportunity for you to grow your\u00a0business.In the case of Justin.tv, pivoting to serve video gamers was the right move. Our video game broadcasters always represented a small but consistent group of users. It tooks us 4-5 years to realize how important they were. Serving them didn\u2019t change the costs of the business too much: our major costs were salaries and bandwidth and we didn\u2019t care what video was being streamed as long as people were watching and chatting. Also it opened up monetization avenues that were very interesting: online video advertisers would prefer to advertise against video gameplay than general UGC\u00a0content.Saying NoIf you decide you want to serve this customer that is okay! Remember that being good at customer service doesn\u2019t mean serving every potential customer. You should always be courteous with people you can\u2019t serve but you shouldn\u2019t feel bad telling them that you\u2019re focused on solving another problem. They\u2019ll survive and you\u2019ll be much more likely to serve your target customers better. Also, focusing in on a specific problem will help you find product/market\u00a0fit.In the early days, by focusing on solving one problem really well, you\u2019re betting on making a small amount of people very happy. If you let any user that walks in the door steer the product roadmap you\u2019re going to end up doing a shitty job at half-solving a lot of\u00a0problems.",

      "content": "It is much easier to talk to an investor if they understand what your company does. As a founder you\u2019ll have to pitch your startup countless times. To be effective, your pitch has to be clear and\u00a0concise.In this post I\u2019ve condensed the pitch creation process to answering seven questions. If you can answer all seven questions succinctly you\u2019ll be well ahead of the\u00a0curve.\u00a0The Seven Questions\u00a01. What do you do?Start with the name of your company and what it does. For example \u201cSocialcam is a mobile app that makes it easy to take videos and share them with friends and family.\u201d There\u2019s no need to set up the problem, you can just get to the\u00a0point.\u00a0Too many people spend too much energy trying to make their idea sound impressive. It\u2019s ok to keep it simple. Actually, it\u2019s preferable. You want to explain what you do in the simplest language possible. This needs to be predigested. Your elevator pitch should be like baby\u00a0food.\u00a0If you\u2019re having trouble communicating your product simply, walking me through the user path can be an effective tactic. For example, \u201cWe\u2019re Google. We build a website with a box in it. You can type any question into that box and we\u2019ll show you websites that answer that\u00a0question.\u201d\u00a0Walking me through the user path helps avoid explanations like, \u201cWe\u2019re Google. We organize the world\u2019s information by indexing the web.\u201d With that description I\u2019m\u00a0lost.\u00a0Your goal when answering this question should not be to have me understand your whole business but rather make me interested enough to ask follow-up\u00a0questions.\u00a02. How big is the market?There are two ways to get market size. If you\u2019re entering a pre-existing space (like small business banking) you can research it. If you\u2019re creating a new product or space (like Slack), you can estimate the number of customers that would want your product and approximate how much you could charge\u00a0them.\u00a0For example: Bellabeat makes an activity tracker for women. There are X women between 14 and 45 in the US. The lifecycle of our activity tracker is two years. Our market opportunity in the US is\u00a0Y.\u00a0When you\u2019re estimating market size and what % you could own, there are two methods: top down and bottom up. With the top down approach you determine the total market and estimate your potential share of it. With bottom up you figure out where comparable products are sold, how many of them are sold, and what % of those sales you could take. I prefer the bottom up method because it helps you avoid a common top down pitfall, which is not narrowing down the customer enough. In the example above that could mean assuming all women are in your market - no matter their age or\u00a0nationality.\u00a03. What\u2019s your progress?What I\u2019m trying to understand here is how fast you produce work. What is the ratio between what you\u2019ve done and how long you\u2019ve been working on\u00a0it?\u00a0I want to feel impressed with how much you\u2019ve done in the period of time you\u2019ve had to do it. This can apply to a company that\u2019s one week old or ten years\u00a0old.\u00a0I also tend to value product development and customers first and other things such as fundraising or biz dev deals a distant\u00a0second.\u00a04. What\u2019s your unique insight?This is similar to \u201cWhat problem are you solving?\u201d but the bar is higher. What I really want to understand is what you know about the problem that everyone else doesn\u2019t. This is usually derived from multiple conversations with customers, deep analysis of current products in the space, and often personal\u00a0experience.\u00a0For example: Gmail. A unique insight was that the email inbox is a personal database of communication and documents. Why would a user ever want to delete anything in their personal database? Gmail gave people enough storage so they would never have to delete a conversation. It\u2019s not that people needed email. It already existed. And it\u2019s not that people needed better email. That\u2019s too vague. A unique insight is specific and doesn\u2019t contain complicated\u00a0language.\u00a0Between your market and your unique insight, you have two opportunities to teach me something. A startup\u2019s unique insight often gives me more of an aha moment than the explanation of what the company\u00a0does.\u00a0It\u2019s worth noting that passion doesn\u2019t help here. Saying a bad unique insight forcefully makes you look worse, not better. For example, \u201cDude, email today is fucking\u00a0broken.\u201d\u00a05. What\u2019s your business model?There are two types of startups, those that know how they\u2019ll make money and those that haven\u2019t figured it out yet. By and large, if you\u2019re in the second category you\u2019re going to either make money by growing big and turning on advertising or you\u2019re going to copy the predominant business model in your space. A small subset of companies in the second category will propose a new business model that makes sense given how you product changes the market\u2013freemium is a good example of\u00a0this.\u00a0One mistake I often used to make at Justin.tv was offering a potpourri of business models (virtual goods, product placement, chat ads, contests, etc..). I was embarrassed to say Justin.tv would monetize with advertising when clearly that was the only answer. Own the simple business\u00a0model.\u00a06. Who\u2019s on your team?I\u2019m only interested in a few things: How many founders? Is there a technical co-founder? How long have they known each other? Is everyone working full time? What is the equity split among the founders (hopefully equal or close to\u00a0equal)?\u00a0If there\u2019s an extremely relevant credential I also want to hear that. For example: You\u2019re building a rocket company and you used to be the rocket scientist for SpaceX. Basically, if you\u2019re focusing on a deeply complex or regulated space, having the expertise in house to plausibly tackle those problems is\u00a0important.\u00a0You don\u2019t need to mention your GPA or that you once worked at\u00a0Google.\u00a07. What do you want?There\u2019s no need to dance around the ask. If you want me to invest, ask. If you have a question, ask. Though to be clear, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d is a bad question. \u201cDo I have a good idea?\u201d is another bad\u00a0question.\u00a0Make it easy for me to help you. I want to help\u00a0you.\u00a0Improving Your AnswersOnce you have answers to each of the seven questions your challenge is to make the answers as clear as possible. To do that you need to eliminate jargon, acronyms, marketing speak, and any ambiguous terms such as \u201cplatform\u201d. Basically, make it sound dumber than you think it\u00a0should.\u00a0One tactic you can try is what I call \u201cThe Email Test\u201d. Write up a two sentence explanation of what your startup does then email it to a smart friend. Ask them to explain it back to you in different words. If they ask any clarifying questions, you need to revise your pitch. It\u2019s important to do this over email because you can\u2019t add explanations as you would in\u00a0conversation.\u00a0One thing we do during the YC batch that most people don\u2019t realize is we help companies with their two sentence pitch. The answer to the question \u201cwhat do you do\u201d? We work on it every group office hours for the entire batch. It\u2019s the linchpin of a good demo day presentation. If that\u2019s locked, writing a good demo day presentation is\u00a0easy.\u00a0The real thing to remember when editing your answers is that you don\u2019t need to sound cool. You need to be clear. Don\u2019t try to have pizzazz. You don\u2019t want\u00a0pizzazz.\u00a0ConclusionI\u2019m much more interested in progress than genius ideas. Most good ideas don\u2019t look like good ideas the first time you see them so your ability to show progress in your work and intellect in how you answer these questions are two very positive signals. Once I understand what you\u2019re working on it\u2019s all about making me believe that it\u2019s plausible that you can\u00a0succeed.\u00a0Recommended ResourcesHow to Start a Startup, Lecture\u00a019\u00a0Thanks to Jared Friedman and Aaron Harris for reading drafts of\u00a0this.",
